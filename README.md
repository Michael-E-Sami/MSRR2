# MSRR2
#### A simple simulation for a two wheeled differential robot that has the ability to attach with other similar robots and can take many forms each with different functionalities.

### To get started to you need to do the following:
The codes are distributed between two ros workspaces which are catkin_ws2_final and catkin_ws2_final using Python2 and Python3 respectively
after downloading the workspaces you need to make the catkin_ws2_final using the command: **catkin_make_isolated**
