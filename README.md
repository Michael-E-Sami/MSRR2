# MSRR2
#### A simple simulation for a two wheeled differential robot that has the ability to attach with other similar robots and can take many forms each with different functionalities.

### To get started to you need to do the following:
The codes are distributed between two ros workspaces which are catkin_ws2_final and catkin_ws2_final using Python2 and Python3 respectively

after downloading the workspaces you need to make the catkin_ws2_final using the command: **catkin_make_isolated**

You need to make catkin_ws3_final using the command: **catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3**

other essential commands to set up everything correctly and in order to build everything successfully:

  sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
  
  wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
  
  sudo apt-get update
  
  sudo apt-get install gazebo9
  
  sudo apt-get install libgazebo9-dev
